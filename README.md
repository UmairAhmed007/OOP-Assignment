1st program
This program is like a little electronic brain that adds two numbers together. The numbers it's adding are 2 and 5. So, it starts with those two numbers, adds them up, and then says, "Hey, 2 plus 5 equals 7!" It's like a super basic calculator. The part that does the talking (or printing, in computer language) is the System.out.println line. It's just telling you the math it did.

2nd program

This program is like a smart tool for handling student data. Imagine you have scores for different students, and this program helps you analyze and understand the data.

Data Input:

It starts with a bunch of student data written in a particular way, like "John:85, Alice:92, Bob:78, Carol:95, David:88, Emma:79, Frank:90".
Then, it splits this big piece of data into smaller chunks using the commas. Each chunk now represents the data for one student.
Data Processing:

It then creates two lists, one for student names and one for their scores.
It goes through each chunk, further splits it using the colon, and puts the name into the names list and the score into the scores list.
While doing this, it also calculates the total score of all students.
Data Analysis:

After collecting all the data, it calculates the average score by dividing the total score by the number of students.
It finds the highest and lowest scores along with the names of the students who achieved them.
Data Output:

Finally, it prints out some useful information:
Total number of students
Average score of all students
Highest score and the student who achieved it
Lowest score and the student who achieved it
So, it's like a mini-data analyst for student scores!
